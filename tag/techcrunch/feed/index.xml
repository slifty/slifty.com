										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago I went to a happy hour organized by the Neiman Lab, I mentioned <a href="/2011/12/trust-me-credibility-is-the-future-of-journalism/">my thesis project</a>, Andrew Phelps said &#8220;that sounds cool, can I write about it?&#8221; and I said &#8220;sure why not!&#8221;  I assumed that the post would get about as much traction as professional blog posts usually get: a few hundred eyeballs and some useful feedback.<br />
<span id="more-695"></span><br />
After <a href="www.niemanlab.org/2011/11/bull-beware-truth-goggles-sniff-out-suspicious-sentences-in-news/">the article was pushed</a> it started getting twitter attention.  Soon afterwards NPR, CBC, and The Register contacted me.   I ended up with a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/27/142821487/truth-goggles-double-checks-what-politicians-say">two-minute piece on Weekend Edition</a>, a longer <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/day6/blog/2011/11/25/interview-truth-goggles/"> interview on Day 6</a>, a surprisingly balanced and long <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/28/true-or-false-automatic-fact-checking-coming-to-the-web-complications-follow/">piece on TechCrunch</a>, and the official <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/28/mit_truth_goggles/">title of Boffin</a> by the crazy Brits.  This was unexpected. </p>
