										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had one of my proudest Internet moments.  I managed to nab a mythical Bag of Crap at the last  wootoff.  Today it finally arrived.  The only thing that really comes close to this was the day that I <a href="http://bash.org/?754254">got a quote accepted on Bash.org</a>.  For those that don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot.com</a> is a deal a day site.  This means what it sounds like &#8211; they sell ONE item each day, and that item is usually something you really do not need.  You still check back because every once in a while they have things you DO need, like a <a href="http://www.woot.com/blog/viewentry.aspx?id=1734">LeakFrog</a>.</p>
<p>Once a month something special happens &#8212; a &#8220;woot off.&#8221;  During a woot off, instead of selling one thing until it sells out, they put up a new item after the last one goes.  This keeps things fresh and exciting!  The real excitement, however, comes from the mythical &#8220;Bag of Crap&#8221; (BoC for short).  This thing costs $3 (+$5 shipping), and it is literally a bunch of random stuff from their warehouse that they decide to put in a box.  It might be a dozen plastic army men, it might be a broken, returned GPS, or it might be 8 ipods and a flat screen TV.  You don&#8217;t know!</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is nearly impossible to get one.  You don&#8217;t know when it will appear, and the servers die almost instantly when it does because every single person clicks the &#8220;buy&#8221; button at once.  But I did it.  I got one, and it arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? Here is the box&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_883" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wootbox1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-883" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wootbox1.jpg" alt="The box of destiny!" title="&quot;Box&quot; of Crap" width="400" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-883" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wootbox1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wootbox1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-883" class="wp-caption-text">Isn&#039;t it pretty?</p></div>
<p>And the contents&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/thehaul1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/thehaul1.jpg" alt="The crap itself" title="The Haul" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/thehaul1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/07/thehaul1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>For those without eagle eyes, the contents are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>ONE (1) official &#8220;Disney my*style&#8221; Mix and Pix accessory case.</li>
<li>THREE (3) 2010 &#8220;Would you Rather&#8221; desktop calendars</li>
<li>ONE (1) Woot! branded flying screaming monkey</li>
</ul>
<p>and (this is the big one)&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>TWO (2) gigantic High School Musical alarm clocks WITH fuzzy pink handles.  They each require 2 &#8220;AA&#8221; batteries (not included)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is perfect!  This is everything I expected to be in a bag of crap, and more!</p>
