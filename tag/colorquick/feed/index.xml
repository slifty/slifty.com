										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t have any clue who will be reading this blog down the line, but right now I can be pretty sure that it is people I know.  To those people &#8211; hello!  Sorry this is so impersonal but I&#8217;m really glad to be able to tell you about what I am expecting to be a really exciting two years.  First, though, I want to catch you all up on what has been happening in the somewhat recent past.  I know I owe you all a lot of explanation since I stopped sharing tomes of stories three or four years ago, but I think all that is lost to the wind at this point&#8230; whoops!</p>
<p>Anyway, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>May 2009 &#8212; I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a BS in Information Systems and minors in Math and Computer Science.</li>
<li>Fall of 2009 &#8212; I applied to the news challenge with my friend Erek Alper.  We made it to the top 50 (out of about 2200).  If we had won we would have been given $300k to create a system that routes questions from citizens to the appropriate government representatives and run a pilot in Cheltenham and Pittsburgh.  Close but no cigar!</li>
<li>2009 to 2010 &#8212; I worked for ColorQuick (http://www.colorquick.com)/ while Lyla was finishing her fifth year at Tyler / Temple and had lots of productive fun in the real world.</li>
<li>Summer 2010 &#8212; I spent working for a new startup called SpeakerText,  where I worked on an interactive transcript tool that people can use to  add text to their online videos (http://www.speakertext.com)/</li>
<li>March 30th, 2010 &#8212; I was informed by Linda Peterson that I was accepted in to the MIT Media Lab graduate program in Media Arts and Sciences for the Fall of 2010.</li>
<li>July 3, 2010 &#8212; I started this blog, which I will begin to update now that its intended purpose is about to start.</li>
<li>July 27th, 2010 &#8212; Starcraft 2 was released.  (http://www.starcraft2.com). / This began two weeks of getting absolutely  nothing done.  Then I had to get married so that ruined all my fun!</li>
<li>August 21st, 2010 &#8212; I married Lyla Duey in the Abington Art Center.</li>
<li>August 22nd to August 31st &#8212; we spent nine days in the Gallery Inn, (Old San Juan, Puerto Rico).  It was a glorious, relaxing time.</li>
<li>September 1st &#8212; Lyla, Erek, my dad, and I pack up an entire apartment and drive it to Boston.</li>
<li>September 4th &#8212; Lyla moves to Spain for a 10 month program as a Fulbright Scholar.  Very exciting!  (but, of course, very sad <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
</ul>
<p>I think more happened, but this is good enough for now.  There, now nobody can say I didn&#8217;t provide basic context for these posts.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the honeymoon for those that like mushey stuff:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Honeymoon.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124" title="Honeymoon" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Honeymoon.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="245" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been working for a small web to print company called <a href="http://www.colorquick.com/">ColorQuick</a> since June of 2009 to keep me from becoming a homeless person while I waited for Lyla to finish her five-year-long art degree.  Apparently it isn&#8217;t possible to graduate on time if you are a student at <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tyler/">Tyler</a>.</p>
<p>The experience was worthwhile, and I learned a lot of good habits along with plenty of things I will forever know to avoid.  The most important takeaway is the value of good project management.  This doesn&#8217;t even have to do with following a particular development methodology &#8212; I am simply talking about having someone who is in charge of fostering and championing a clear vision of the product.  Someone with the time to keep the team organized and moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m out, though, I&#8217;m doing my best to hit the scalding hot summer ground running.  Between today and September I will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working for a truly great startup called <a href="http://www.speakertext.com/">SpeakerText</a>.  They provide interactive transcripts for online videos and I&#8217;m working on the transcript player.</li>
<li>Teaching a few friends how to create web applications (i.e. the art of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://mysql.org/">MySQL</a>,  and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>), and working with them on a long-term pet project known to those that know me as <a href="http://thegpf.com/">The GPF</a> (The Globally Personalized Forum).  It&#8217;s going to be a system for group-based-yet-still-personalized communication.</li>
<li>Watching the entire series of Battlestar Galactica for the first time.</li>
<li>Planning a wedding, spending time with my fiance before  she has  to  leave for Spain, and finding an apartment in Cambridge before I have to move there for MIT.  You know, those little things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it is 2:00 in the morning, I&#8217;ll abruptly end this ice breaker post with a comment:  If you have ever used Craig&#8217;s list to find apartments and said to yourself &#8220;damn it, I wish I could just see these things on a fracking map&#8221; then rejoice for <a href="http://padmapper.com/">Padmapper.com</a>.</p>
