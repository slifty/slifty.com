										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With my thesis complete I&#8217;m about to embark on the next phase in life, and in true Millennial fashion it will last about 10 months because job security is for chumps.  I&#8217;m going to be a Knight-Mozilla Fellow (feel free to call me &#8220;Mr. Fellow&#8221;) working in <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/">The Boston Globe</a> as part of the <a href="http://opennews.org/">Open News</a> project led by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>My first full day was yesterday and I&#8217;m just about finished a post about my first impressions and lessons learned.  Before I hit publish on that, though, I want to give a nod to the option I decided <em>not</em> to pursue: a PhD at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Path</h2>
<p>I ultimately decided not to apply to the PhD program at the Media Lab for now.  This wasn&#8217;t easy (and doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t come back and apply later), but it came down to a few points:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/yunodoctorate-e1338930095522.jpg" alt="" title="yunodoctorate" width="280" height="280" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-803" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/yunodoctorate-e1338930095522.jpg 280w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/06/yunodoctorate-e1338930095522-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/06/yunodoctorate-e1338930095522-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m not really a great academic.</strong>  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the motto of &#8220;Demo or Die&#8221; generally trumps &#8220;Publish or Perish&#8221; at the Media Lab, but this doesn&#8217;t change the fact that a PhD is ultimately an academic endeavor.  When it comes to technology my natural inclination is to code and blog, not to design studies and write scientific papers.</p>
<p><strong>I got a huge amount out of my time at the lab.</strong> Yes, the awesome ability of the Media Lab to jump start lives is actually part of why I&#8217;m moving on.  In two years I feel empowered to create anything I want, I&#8217;ve redefined my understanding of the world, quadrupled my confidence, developed an amazing network of friends and connections, and  become part of a wonderful community.  I&#8217;m sure that four more years at the lab would continue improvement on all of those fronts, but I doubt that it would be nearly as saturated.</p>
<p><strong>Four years is much longer than 10 months.</strong> Call me an opportunist but I&#8217;m married, and who knows where Lyla and I will want to be over the next four years.  Actually it turns out we do know (Lyla got into RISD and starts her graduate program in September), but that isn&#8217;t the point.  Locking myself into something for four years seems dangerous at a time when there are so many problems to solve and ideas to pursue.  What would have happened if Luke just chilled out with Yoda for four years?</p>
<p>All of that being said, if I ever commit to a PhD it will be at the Media Lab.  I already miss the place!  Luckily I&#8217;ll stay an official part of it for at least another year as a &#8220;zero cost visiting researcher.&#8221;  This means I don&#8217;t get paid, but I get to keep access to resources and have a good explanation as to why I&#8217;m still skulking around the hallways at night.</p>
<p>This leaves me here, living the Tolkien dream and beginning a brand new fellowship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Happy New Year everyone!</span></h1>
<p>This has unquestionably been the most eventful year of my life to date (other than the year I was born).  At the risk of sounding self-absorbed I’m going to list the highlights so that it can go down in my personal history.</p>
<p>Here are the bullet points of what happened in pseudo-chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Erek and I made it to the top 50 applications of the Knight News Challenge (out of about 2,400)</li>
<li>Google called me out of the blue asking for an interview (funny story behind this one)</li>
<li>Lyla received a Fulbright Scholarship to go to Spain</li>
<li>I was accepted into the MIT Media Lab</li>
<li>Lyla graduated from Temple University, finishing her five-year undergraduate program.</li>
<li>My childhood dog – Mrs. Duffy – had to be put to sleep <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>I ended my time working for <a href="http://colorquick.com/" target="_blank">ColorQuick</a></li>
<li>I got a book published!  Sort of.</li>
<li>Lyla and I drove 1000 miles in less than a week: Cheltenham to New York to Boston to O.C. Maryland back to Cheltenham</li>
<li>I spent a summer working for <a href="http://speakertext.com/" target="_blank">SpeakerText</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J6-3l3hCm0" target="_blank">STARCRAFT 2</a> CAME OUT!!!!</li>
<li>I got married</li>
<li>Lyla and I spent 10 days in Puerto Rico</li>
<li>We <a href="/2010/09/the-first-24-hours-of-boston/" target="_blank">moved to Boston</a></li>
<li>Lyla moved to Spain to begin her Fulbright</li>
<li>I started my first semester at MIT</li>
<li>I learned how to make almost anything</li>
<li>I completed my first semester at MIT</li>
<li>Lyla and I spent Thanksgiving in France</li>
<li>I visited Lyla in Spain for Christmas and New Years</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too shabby!  This year contained my wedding, two jobs, two post-graduate programs, three countries, and one U.S. territory.</p>
<p>Also, for a few months in there Lyla and I were in solid running for: a $400,000 grant, employment at Google, graduate school at MIT, and a Fulbright scholarship.  Holy crap.</p>
<p>As for you 2011, the excitement bar is set pretty far up there. No pressure.</p>
