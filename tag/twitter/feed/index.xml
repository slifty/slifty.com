										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This short post is about counting to 24.  If that doesn&#8217;t sound interesting to you, tu&#8211;oh who am I kidding, of course it sounds interesting!</p>
<p>Twitter keeps asking me to give them money so that I can be popular. My brain tells me that this is an opportunity that they offer everyone &#8212; some kind of general campaign in a desperate attempt to validate the dumbest business model since Facebook&#8217;s digital bananas. I usually just hit delete and move on.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what my heart says.  Over the months their persistence impressed me, and I decided that my account must be special in their system.  I must be up there with BP and Exxon.  I started dreaming about the possibilities being as Twitter famous as Elvis would have been, if only for a day. My wit and pith would change the lives of everyone who could experience it.</p>
<p>This is why, on July 4th, 2013 I decided to define the national dialogue by promoting a tweet of my own.  I learned that Twitter charges you when people interact (click, reply, retweet) with your promoted message.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll stop here and tell the rest of the story through the digital communication equivalent of interpretive dance:</p>
