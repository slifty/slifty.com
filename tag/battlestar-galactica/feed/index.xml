										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been working for a small web to print company called <a href="http://www.colorquick.com/">ColorQuick</a> since June of 2009 to keep me from becoming a homeless person while I waited for Lyla to finish her five-year-long art degree.  Apparently it isn&#8217;t possible to graduate on time if you are a student at <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tyler/">Tyler</a>.</p>
<p>The experience was worthwhile, and I learned a lot of good habits along with plenty of things I will forever know to avoid.  The most important takeaway is the value of good project management.  This doesn&#8217;t even have to do with following a particular development methodology &#8212; I am simply talking about having someone who is in charge of fostering and championing a clear vision of the product.  Someone with the time to keep the team organized and moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m out, though, I&#8217;m doing my best to hit the scalding hot summer ground running.  Between today and September I will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working for a truly great startup called <a href="http://www.speakertext.com/">SpeakerText</a>.  They provide interactive transcripts for online videos and I&#8217;m working on the transcript player.</li>
<li>Teaching a few friends how to create web applications (i.e. the art of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://mysql.org/">MySQL</a>,  and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>), and working with them on a long-term pet project known to those that know me as <a href="http://thegpf.com/">The GPF</a> (The Globally Personalized Forum).  It&#8217;s going to be a system for group-based-yet-still-personalized communication.</li>
<li>Watching the entire series of Battlestar Galactica for the first time.</li>
<li>Planning a wedding, spending time with my fiance before  she has  to  leave for Spain, and finding an apartment in Cambridge before I have to move there for MIT.  You know, those little things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it is 2:00 in the morning, I&#8217;ll abruptly end this ice breaker post with a comment:  If you have ever used Craig&#8217;s list to find apartments and said to yourself &#8220;damn it, I wish I could just see these things on a fracking map&#8221; then rejoice for <a href="http://padmapper.com/">Padmapper.com</a>.</p>
