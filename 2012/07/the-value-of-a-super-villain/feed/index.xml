					<description><![CDATA[Turns out, readers can be their own worst super villain, for as we learned today, Anonymous created a replica of the Times online Opinion page and had &quot;Bill Keller&quot; express complete, rather than his actual conflicted, support of WikiLeaks: http://www.opinion-nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/keller-a-post-postscript.html They followed it with a similar hoax statement from PayPal: http://www.thepaypalblog.co/2012/07/statement-on-nytimes.html

Some really important journalism ethics people fell for it, including our friend Dan Gillmor and the more prominent Glen Greenwald.

Now, there certainly was some cleverness: the Keller piece lifted text Keller had actually written in the past. But are we really still at the point that &quot;opinion-nytimes.com&quot; and &quot;thepaypalblog.co&quot; don&#039;t give it away?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dan, if you really really want to destroy a newspaper, the formula is very complex and top secret but I&#039;ll share it with you just this once. You ready? Here it is:

Retain the current management team. Do business as usual. Repeat.

Ok Dan, there you have it. Now go forth to plunder and destroy. ]]></description>
