Censorship is imposed on another person via force. 
Your argument is self defeating.
Using force against other humans is wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i won&#039;t bother defending the virtues of privacy and free trade from mouthbreathers who moralize while supporting the genocide of &#039;people that like to eat things that make them feel different&#039; and people caught in the crossfire of the cartels born of prohibition. there&#039;s no moral argument to be made to someone who doesn&#039;t think your life is your own to do with as you wish.


instead i&#039;ll just note that said bootlickers have been thoroughly defeated, and that anyone can do anything they want with a little bit of knowledge and TOR, and there is nothing you can do to stop them. see, people who value freedom are more intelligent then you, and you don&#039;t have any comparable system you could use to defeat the ones that freedom has created. those who want to be left alone will always be one step ahead of the bootlickers that can&#039;t stand people doing business without being taxed or controlled.]]></description>

I&#039;m not so shocked by your idiot retard statement, but am that other mouth-breathing pedophile smack-junkie morons up-voted your comment.


Hope you get butt-raped by a Gorilla while someone films it, than posts it on one of the &quot;censorship free&quot; pages you want to champion so badly.]]></description>
