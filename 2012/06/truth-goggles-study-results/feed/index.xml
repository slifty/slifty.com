					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for conducting this study and for the easy-to-read results. The results are interesting on many levels. I wonder what the effects of longer-term use of Truth Goggles would be on the entrenched believers. Although they didn&#039;t seem to shift opinion in this study, I think belief in a candidate/party/ideology changes as each so-called fact is questioned over a longer period. Certainly the heavily polarized US media of today requires a tool like this to give readers what was intended by a &#039;free press&#039;: serious analysis and presentation of different opinions (now reduced to a niche called fact-checking). I would pay a small fee for a plug-in like this. Best of luck to you, Dan. And thanks again.]]></description>
