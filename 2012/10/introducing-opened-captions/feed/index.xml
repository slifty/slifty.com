You are correct!  I unfortunately ended up deciding to stop paying for cable (I was subscribed only for Opened Captions) because I wasn&#039;t able to get any support for the project.  I&#039;m still looking for ways to get the stream back up; if you know any organizations interested in hosting a copy of the tool I would love to turn it on again!]]></description>

I don&#039;t mean that. What I mean is provide a way for a captioner who is captioning an event, no a TV broadcast, to send their text over the internet so it can be viewed on an Opened Captions website.]]></description>

If I understand well, you would propose to involve the whole community in doing closed caption? that would be great ! (even if that would probably generate a lot of mess)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

it looks like a very interesting tool/library. However I am new in that field and there are various things that I do not understand. I downloaded open-cations and installed it locally. It works directly, out of the box! Great! I can launch the server using the command &#062;&#062;node app, and then I can visualize the page on localhost:3000.

However, what I don&#039;t understand is how to connect this server with a tv+caption stream. Eg, how to connect it with C-SPAN. More specifically, to get all the closed captions info from that channel.



Other questions, do you know other channels that I can get with your tools? For example, I am interested with european channels. Would it works? (perhaps I should have first a special box?)
Any ideas? hints?


Thank you for your help and happy new year,
Herve.]]></description>
