					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering about a mechanism that marks the questionable passages more intensely when more people find it to be inaccurate.

The worst lies/myths might be exposed more quickly that way?

Don&#039;t mind me.  Just suggesting ways to make this massive project much harder.  You can thank me later.

Yup, the Nyhan/Reifler study is really interesting. It highlights all the hidden influences on reasoning. It&#039;s been misinterpreted in some really weird ways though &lt;a href=&quot;https://mariawolters.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-a-post-on-biased-thinking-used-research-twisted-to-fit-its-own-bias/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;see here &lt;/a&gt; for example. ]]></description>

Thanks for pointing that out -- I am going to write about all that stuff soon, and that Nyhan/Reifler study is the motivation behind that claim (didn&#039;t mean to make it sound like it was totally my invention, but hey what are blogs are for if not ambiguously originating theories).  Personal affirmation isn&#039;t quite the same thing although it&#039;s hitting very similar buttons.  Unfortunately I don&#039;t think that the mechanism the tested could ever exist in the real world in that format (You aren&#039;t going to write a letter to yourself every time you read an article!)]]></description>
