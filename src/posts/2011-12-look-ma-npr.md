Three weeks ago I went to a happy hour organized by the Neiman Lab, I mentioned [my thesis project](/2011/12/trust-me-credibility-is-the-future-of-journalism/), Andrew Phelps said “that sounds cool, can I write about it?” and I said “sure why not!” I assumed that the post would get about as much traction as professional blog posts usually get: a few hundred eyeballs and some useful feedback.  
  
After [the article was pushed](/2011/12/look-ma-npr/www.niemanlab.org/2011/11/bull-beware-truth-goggles-sniff-out-suspicious-sentences-in-news/) it started getting twitter attention. Soon afterwards NPR, CBC, and The Register contacted me. I ended up with a [two-minute piece on Weekend Edition](http://www.npr.org/2011/11/27/142821487/truth-goggles-double-checks-what-politicians-say), a longer [interview on Day 6](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/blog/2011/11/25/interview-truth-goggles/), a surprisingly balanced and long [piece on TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/28/true-or-false-automatic-fact-checking-coming-to-the-web-complications-follow/), and the official [title of Boffin](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/28/mit_truth_goggles/) by the crazy Brits. This was unexpected.
