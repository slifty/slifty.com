[This was a triumph.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI)  
I’m making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS  
It’s hard to overstate my satisfaction.

I’m alive and kickin’ and I’m in Spain.  I just drafted a lengthy post for the [PBS IdeaLab](http://pbs.org/idealab) which I’ll link to once it is up, but I have a nice backlog of things to write about here as well.  Thank goodness I’ll be spending a few weeks in a country where every day everyone spends three hours in the afternoon just eating and relaxing!
