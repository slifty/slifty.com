This is a test post to verify that the Eleventy setup is working correctly.

## Features Being Tested

This post is testing several key features:

1. **Markdown rendering** with proper formatting
2. **Frontmatter parsing** including categories and tags
3. **Permalink generation** using the WordPress-compatible `/YYYY/MM/slug/` format
4. **Layout rendering** with the post template
5. **RSS feed generation**

## Typography Test

Here's some regular paragraph text using PT Serif. The body text should be readable and comfortable to read.

### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with **bold text**
- Fourth item with *italic text*

Ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Code Blocks

Inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, world!";`

Block code:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10));
```

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote testing the styling. It should have a left border and italic text, just like the original WordPress theme.

## Links and Formatting

Here's a [link to the homepage](/). Links should be properly styled with the site's color scheme.

This paragraph has **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text*** to test typography.

## Conclusion

If you can read this post with proper formatting, categories, and tags displayed, then the Eleventy setup is working correctly!
