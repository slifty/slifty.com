I don’t have any clue who will be reading this blog down the line, but right now I can be pretty sure that it is people I know.  To those people – hello!  Sorry this is so impersonal but I’m really glad to be able to tell you about what I am expecting to be a really exciting two years.  First, though, I want to catch you all up on what has been happening in the somewhat recent past.  I know I owe you all a lot of explanation since I stopped sharing tomes of stories three or four years ago, but I think all that is lost to the wind at this point… whoops!

Anyway, here goes:

-   May 2009 — I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a BS in Information Systems and minors in Math and Computer Science.
-   Fall of 2009 — I applied to the news challenge with my friend Erek Alper.  We made it to the top 50 (out of about 2200).  If we had won we would have been given $300k to create a system that routes questions from citizens to the appropriate government representatives and run a pilot in Cheltenham and Pittsburgh.  Close but no cigar!
-   2009 to 2010 — I worked for ColorQuick (http://www.colorquick.com) while Lyla was finishing her fifth year at Tyler / Temple and had lots of productive fun in the real world.
-   Summer 2010 — I spent working for a new startup called SpeakerText, where I worked on an interactive transcript tool that people can use to add text to their online videos (http://www.speakertext.com)
-   March 30th, 2010 — I was informed by Linda Peterson that I was accepted in to the MIT Media Lab graduate program in Media Arts and Sciences for the Fall of 2010.
-   July 3, 2010 — I started this blog, which I will begin to update now that its intended purpose is about to start.
-   July 27th, 2010 — Starcraft 2 was released. (http://www.starcraft2.com).  This began two weeks of getting absolutely nothing done.  Then I had to get married so that ruined all my fun!
-   August 21st, 2010 — I married Lyla Duey in the Abington Art Center.
-   August 22nd to August 31st — we spent nine days in the Gallery Inn, (Old San Juan, Puerto Rico).  It was a glorious, relaxing time.
-   September 1st — Lyla, Erek, my dad, and I pack up an entire apartment and drive it to Boston.
-   September 4th — Lyla moves to Spain for a 10 month program as a Fulbright Scholar.  Very exciting!  (but, of course, very sad 🙁 )

I think more happened, but this is good enough for now.  There, now nobody can say I didn’t provide basic context for these posts.

Here is a picture of the honeymoon for those that like mushey stuff:
