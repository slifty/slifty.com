My website has been on wordpress since forever, but why.  It's down more than it's up since nothing has been upgraded and I'm sure it's mining bitcoin for someone.

This is moving it to become a static site.

It's starting as just a static dump of WordPress.  Maybe it'll evolve when I find the time.
