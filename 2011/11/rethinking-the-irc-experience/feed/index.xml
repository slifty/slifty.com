					<description><![CDATA[I lol&#039;d at the heavy breathing part.Â  Well said man, you pretty much got IRC described perfectly.Â  I didn&#039;t know those things about Linkinus, but I guess I&#039;ll take my friend&#039;s advice who has been trying to get me to buy it for months now.
Your description of the two &quot;issues&quot; are dead on also.Â  I quote issues because sometimes, at least personally, you can enjoy the quiet or the chaotic flow of conversations.Â  For my channels I solve the quiet problem by having a bot post relevant news articles from feeds online at most once an hour just to spark up some discussions.

The noise problem is much more complicated.Â  All I can think of from the top of my head is to disable join/part/quit notifications for that channel, highlight different users in different colors, or tell them to get a room :)

Perhaps you can do some clustering by figuring out who is talking to whom and color all their chat a certain color, rather than each person.Â  Or go a step further and color based on current discussed subject.

I&#039;d be interested to hear what you had in mind or if you&#039;ve gotten any thing developed.

Cool blog btw, bookmarked.]]></description>
