					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/11/anonymous-project-update/#comment-174&quot;&gt;Deadpoohbear&lt;/a&gt;.

Many thanks for pointing that out  (I never expected to be entirely correct!)

I&#039;ll add in a note reflecting this distinction.  In fact, I&#039;ll add a note stressing how complex it all is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are not entirely correct about Anon and the lulz, my friend. While there is a high priority placed on that, (especially among the youngest among us notably referred to as the lulzfags) there is also a very strong code of morality among others--especially where issues of censorship is involved.  (This latter faction is, appropriately, referred to as the  moralfags.) While there is no doubt that Anon&#039;s support of the Occupations has provided plenty of lulz fodder, make no mistake--we are RABIDLY serious about furthering that agenda.
