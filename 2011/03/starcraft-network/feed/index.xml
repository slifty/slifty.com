					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/starcraft-network/#comment-157&quot;&gt;clord&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;d disagree. The unix philosophy is about small programs that do one thing and do it right. I think this fits the Zerg a lot better.

And besides, there are many things about Windows that could be considered hacked together. :P

Sending this from my black Macbook 13&quot; named Rogue... from my X-Men naming scheme. Apart from Xavier being the name of my AP and Cerebro being the Wireless connection&#039;s name, I mostly pick names willy-nilly :P]]></description>

You caught me :(  I should probably have actually called it either Cerebrate or Overmind but those are buildings... Although NAS is kind of a utility and less a computer so it might be OK.  This is where that art comes in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. I really enjoy when people try to name their servers with some convention, not some random names and numbers.
Personally, I use Eve Online naming convention, so far applied that to two computers:
15&quot; Laptop named Phobos - named after medium sized ship can withstand a  bit.
And standard,  Bigtower PC named Leviathan - after one of the biggest ship in the game. :)

Reusing your convention I would have to go like this:
Gallente for nicely designed boxes (like Apple products), because of their curvy lines.
Minmatar names for various UX boxes, because they look like they were found in scrapyard.
Caldari for normal Windows, because those ships look like there were made from one block of steel (well, MacBooks are unibody ;-).
I still don&#039;t know about Ammar - they designs are neat, but they miss thing or two.

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice, I do the same thing but with Ender&#039;s Game as the theme.  Routers all get planet names, computer&#039;s are named after characters, then I link technologies to other things that need naming (for example the wireless network is named ansible).  I do like the use of races to differentiate the OS on the computer.]]></description>
